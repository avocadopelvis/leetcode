# https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Use Hashmaps (Dictionary)
# Keep count of characters in both strings & compare to see if they're the same.
# Only downside to this method is memory complexity since we create 2 hashmaps

# Alternate Method:
# Sort the strings. If they contain the same characters then on sorting, they should be equal.

# Another quick way is to use Counter() which  is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects.
# Meaning that itâ€™s the same as the first method.

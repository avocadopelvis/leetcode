# Use hashmap (dictionary) to store the opening & closing brackets
# Use stack for opening brackets

# Iterate through the string
# If opening bracket, append it to the stack
# Else if itâ€™s the closing bracket and the stack is empty(meaning there is no opening bracket) or opening bracket doesn't match, return False
# Finally check if the stack still contains unmatched left bracket

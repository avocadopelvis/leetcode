# https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

# Use dictionary (hashmap) to keep track of the numbers seen (index -> key, value-> value)
	
# • Enumerate the array to get index & value
# • Calculate the remaining i.e target - value (current)
# • If the remaining is in the dictionary then we're done (Since current value + remaining = target)
#   If not then add it to the dictionary (we continue until we find the required remaining for the target)

# The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N), where N is the total number of elements in the given array.
# The space complexity will also be O(N), as, in the worst case, we will be pushing N numbers in the HashTable.

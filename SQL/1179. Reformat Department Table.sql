SELECT id,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Jan" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Jan_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Feb" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Feb_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Mar" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Mar_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Apr" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Apr_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "May" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS May_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Jun" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Jun_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Jul" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Jul_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Aug" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Aug_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Sep" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Sep_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Oct" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Oct_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Nov" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Nov_Revenue,
SUM(CASE WHEN month = "Dec" THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Dec_Revenue
FROM Department
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY id;


-- If you don't use the group by and run such query:

-- SELECT id,
-- CASE WHEN month = "Jan" THEN revenue END as "Jan_Revenue",
-- CASE WHEN month = "Feb" THEN revenue END AS "Feb_Revenue"
-- FROM Department;

-- this will return multiple rows for each id + month pair:

-- +----+-------------+-------------+
-- | id | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue |
-- +----+-------------+-------------+
-- |  1 |        NULL |        7000 |
-- |  1 |        8000 |        NULL |
-- |  1 |        NULL |        NULL |
-- |  2 |        9000 |        NULL |
-- |  3 |        NULL |       10000 |
-- +----+-------------+-------------+

-- To get one row for each id we need to aggregate by id using GROUP BY. 
-- But since we have multiple rows with the same id but different values (e.g. for id=1 we have Jan_Revenues: NULL, 8000 and NULL. 
-- When we merge these 3 together what value should be chosen? This is why we need either SUM (NULL+8000+NULL) or MAX, in both cases 8000 will be used.
